  caveats <<~EOS
    Amai lives in the menu bar. Open it once to start onboarding:
      open #{appdir}/Amai.app

    Your memory is stored as Markdown in ~/.amai/memory by default and is kept
    when Amai is uninstalled.

    The read-only MCP server for external agents is at:
      #{appdir}/Amai.app/Contents/MacOS/amai-mcp
